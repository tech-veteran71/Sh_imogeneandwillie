            "text_3": "if you have a pair of 100% cotton imogene + willie jeans, you can expect the fabric to relax with consistent wear. the jeans will soften and loosen a bit where it receives the most stress (around the hips, thighs, knees). if you have a pair of imogene + willie jeans in a stretch fabric, you can expect a minimal amount of stretch. we choose stretch fabrics that are meant to hold their shape. while you should account for the fabric to naturally relax in certain areas, you should always purchase a jean that fits comfortably (though a tad snug) on first try.",
            "accordian_title_4": "what does “rigid” or “raw” denim mean?",
            "text_4": "the terms \"rigid\" and \"raw\" refer to denim that is completely unwashed. nowadays, most jeans are pre-washed for softness and a worn-in look. by contrast, rigid jeans are dark and stiff. they require a break-in period and mold to the wearer’s body. to set the record straight, \"rigid\" denim does not mean \"no-stretch.\" it refers only to unwashed denim. so technically, an unwashed pair of stretch denim can also be rigid. however, at imogene + willie, all of our stretch jeans have been rinsed or washed. they are not \"rigid\" or \"raw.\" while we truly love breaking in a pair of rigid jeans, we develop each style, fit and fabric with you in mind. we hope that you’ll find the right jean to break in and make your own - worn in with your story.",
            "accordian_title_5": "what does the term “selvage” mean?",
            "text_5": "the term “selvage” refers to the finished edge of fabric produced on a shuttle loom. this clean edge is produced by one continuous cross thread (the weft) that is passed back and forth through the vertical threads (the warp) during the production of fabric. because shuttle looms create narrow pieces of fabric, a longer piece is needed to produce a single pair of jeans.",
            "accordian_title_6": "are imogene + willie jeans preshrunk?",
            "text_6": "our rigid fabric jeans are sanforized, a process that happens when the fabric is being made to reduce shrinkage. all of our washes, stretch blends, as well as tops for men and women are rinsed for shrinkage. however, you should expect a small amount of shrinkage at first wash. different fabrics will shrink varying amounts. please get in touch with our team for more details.",
            "accordian_title_7": "i plan to pre-soak my rigid imogene + willie jeans. are your rigid jeans shrink-to-fit?",
            "text_7": "our rigid jeans have a minimal amount of shrinkage at first wash. they do not shrink multiple sizes like some true shrink-to-fit fabrics. if you are interested in pre-soaking one of our rigid jeans, we recommend purchasing true to size.",
            "accordian_title_8": "what is an \"inseam?\"",
            "text_8": "inseam refers to the length of the inside seam of your pants, from the center crotch point all the way down to the bottom of your jean.",

            "text_9": "o. while we do know that washing your jeans can result in minor shrinkage, we recommend that you have them hemmed at the time of purchase when shopping in our stores. our staff is trained to help you find the right size. when ordering online, we recommend you find the right size and fit before requesting a hem. please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:help@imogeneandwillie.com\">help@imogeneandwillie.com<\/a> if you have any questions.",
            "accordian_title_10": "what does \"rise\" mean?",
            "text_10": "this term refers most commonly to the \"front rise\" of a jean, or the distance from the center point of the crotch (where the seams meet) to the waistband above the top button. \"back rise\" refers to the distance from the center point of the crotch all the way to the top of the waistband in the back.",
            "accordian_title_11": "where is the \"yoke\" of a jean?",
            "text_11": "the yoke is the v-shaped section at the back of the jeans that gives jeans their curved seat. the yoke can range from very straight to a deep V shape and is related to the curve created in a jean. the basics: the deeper the yoke, the greater the curve in the seat.",
            "accordian_title_12": "what are rivets?",

            "accordian_title_2": "how often should I wash my imogene + willie jeans?",
            "text_2": "there’s really no right answer to this question. we’ve seen great jeans that are washed every week. we’ve seen beautiful jeans that have never been washed. you can wash before you wear, or wait 6 months for the first wash. we recommend whatever works best for your life. in the end, the only suggestion we have for you is to wear often, and wash not so often. the more you love your jeans, the more they will love you (however, if you like concrete solutions to problems, once every 3 to 6 months is a safe bet).",
            "accordian_title_3": "what’s the best way to treat minor dirt and spots on my jeans?",
            "text_3": "if you want to spot clean your jeans we recommend letting the mess dry first. use a dry rag to gently brush the gunk away, and then slightly dampen the rag and blot the spot. DO NOT SCRUB! the friction from the rag can lift off the indigo on the fabric. if a light spot cleaning doesn’t work, maybe it’s time to give those jeans a wash.",
            "accordian_title_4": "should i put my jeans in the freezer to kill bacteria and odor?",
            "text_4": "as far as we know, there’s no scientific evidence that proves freezing your jeans will kill bacteria or minimize odors, but if it makes you feel good, go for it.",
            "accordian_title_5": "how can I prevent blowouts in my denim?",
            "text_5": "blowouts happen as a result of natural wear, which causes repeated friction and stress on the fabric. we’ve found the best way to keep your jeans lasting longer is to wash them when they’re dirty and repair them when they start to wear through. starch and grime naturally build up around points of friction and will make denim more fragile. a cold soak is the best way to rejuvenate, cleanse and soften the fabric. while you can’t prevent your jeans from wearing out eventually, they will last longer and remain stronger with regular washing and preventative attention. if you see a hole starting to form, get it fixed as soon as possible.",
