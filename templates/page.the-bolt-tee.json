        "text": "each pair of jeans tells a story; this is what we love most. as they fade, crease, dirty, need washing and fade a bit more, they become uniquely yours. how often you wear your jeans, what you do in them, and how you wash them... each aspect will shape the way they age. to keep your jeans around as long as possible, we have a few tips for general care and maintenance for the time between washes.<br><h4>spot cleaning<\/h4>let the mess dry. use a dry rag to brush the gunk away. then slightly dampen the rag and blot the spot. try not to scrub - the friction will lift off the indigo, leaving you with a bright, whiter spot.<h4>odor<\/h4>you can always let them air outside on a nice day, or use a mild odor-fighting fabric spray when needed.<h4>stiffness<\/h4>after air drying for a bit, you'll notice your jeans will be quite stiff. feel free to put your jeans on while they're still damp and wear them until they dry to soften them up. you can also toss them in the dryer, no heat, for a few minutes.<h4>shrinkage<\/h4>washing and drying your jeans can always result in a bit of shrinkage. even with cold water and no heat in the dryer, you may see slight shrinkage with rigid jeans. whenever possible, avoid heat. if you notice shrinkage in length, step on the leg of the jeans while they're still damp, and pull up by the waistband.<h4>dye transfer<\/h4>you may notice some indigo pull out of the jeans during the wash. it's natural and normal! we recommend washing your jeans alone or with other denim.<h4>repairs<\/h4>REPAIRS regular, though infrequent washing, can help prevent damage and holes from appearing. if you ever notice any additional damage, we recommend getting it repaired as soon as possible. imogene + willie offers repair services for all jeans purchased at our stores. (please note that all jeans must be washed with soap and water in order to receive repair services.) email help@imogeneandwillie.com for all repair needs.",
